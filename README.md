* Steps from [Google Codelabs 02.1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-andoid-kotlin-training-custom-views/)

## Introduction

The app creates a circular UI element that resembles a physical fan control. It uses a custom view that extends View to draw a circular fan control dial with an indicator and text labels for the settings: 0 (off), 1 (low), 2 (medium), and 3 (high). When the user clicks the dial, it moves the dial indicator to the next selection, and changes the dial's color from gray to green for selections 1-3 (indicating that the fan power is on).  

Tasks:

* Create Custom View
* Draw the Fan Controller
* Add View Interactivity
* Custom Attributes
* Add Accessibility
